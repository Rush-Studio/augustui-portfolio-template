As both a founder and an investor in the healthtech space, I've developed a unique perspective on what makes healthcare startups successful. At TechBridge Capital, we focus on backing companies that combine innovative technology with deep healthcare expertise.

Our investment thesis centers on three key areas: AI-powered diagnostics, digital therapeutics, and healthcare infrastructure. We believe these areas represent the most promising opportunities for transforming healthcare delivery and improving patient outcomes.

What sets successful healthtech startups apart is their ability to navigate the complex healthcare ecosystem while maintaining a relentless focus on patient needs. This is why we look for founders who not only have technical expertise but also demonstrate a deep understanding of healthcare challenges.
